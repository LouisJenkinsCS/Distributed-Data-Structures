/*
  A 'Collection' is an interface for a data structure that is a 'contract' between
  the user and implementer that it fulfills the following:

  1. Is safe parallel-safe, hence is safe to use across multiple tasks across multiple locales.
  2. Supports the basic operations that any data structure needs to be truly useful, that is:
    a. Insertion of an arbitrary element. From this, we can insert bulk arbitrary elements.
    b. Removal of an arbitrary element. From this, we can remove bulk arbitrary elements.
    c. Iteration over all elements. From this, we can perform lookups over all elements.
  
  From the standpoint of the user, who directly benefits, they obtain a very nice but minimal
  guarantee on the object they are using, and from the implementor's view, they get to the
  benefit from both implementing a well-design interface, and from getting some utility methods 
  'for-free'.
